# Deploy by Multi-node and Database

You can use VelaD to build KubeVela control plane with higher availability. It consists of:

1. More than two nodes as server nodes.
2. One database (Could be MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, etcd)
3. One linux node as load balancer. (Or you can use a cloud load balancer)

We only need run several commands on different nodes.

## Setup server nodes

### First node

On the first server node, run

```shell
velad install --bind-ip=<LB_IP> --database-endpoint=<DB_ENNDPOINT> --token=<TOKEN>
```

`<LB_IP>` is IP of load balancer node. We'll setup it later. Passing it to `bind-ip` helps VelaD generate right
kubeconfig.

`<TOKEN>` is optional. Token will be generated if you don't use this argument. VelaD will print generated or given token
after install.

`<DB_ENDPOINT>` is the database connection string. The format is [here](db-connect-format.md). 
> You need to setup database before and make sure all your server nodes can access it.

### Other nodes

On the other node, you need to run `velad install` with the same arguments and **one more**: `--start`.
`--start` means skip install KubeVela and only start node. These nodes belong to one cluster and don't install KubeVela repeatedly.

```shell
velad install --bind-ip=<LB_IP> --database-endpoint=<DB_ENNDPOINT>\
              --token=<TOKEN> \
              --start
```

`<TOKEN>` should be the same with that in first node.

## Setup load balancer

On load balancer node, run

```shell
velad load-balancer install --host=<IP1>,<IP2>,<IP3>
```

`<IPx>` is  IPs of server nodes. This will call package manager of system 
to install nginx and setup it for forwarding the network traffic to server nodes.

## Access cluster

Run command below on any server nodes. Copy the file to any computer which can access
the load balancer.

```shell
velad kubeconfig --external
```

Boom! You can access the KubeVela control plane with this kubeconfig. Failure of any single server won't 
affect the availability of the control plane.
